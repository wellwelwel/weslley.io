if the market doesn\'t give me opportunities?\\n\\n## \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udd2c The development\\n\\nI could have easily explained what impostor syndrome is and gone straight to the \u201csolution,\u201d but I chose the harder path:\\n\\n\u2014 Exposing my weaknesses throughout my journey, speaking in a tone close to a heartfelt confession.\\n\\nThe goal was to connect with those present, evolve into learning, and maybe inspire through my story, sharing the human side that social media and \\"LinkedIn titles\\" don\'t show.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc7b The challenges\\n\\nTalking about our flaws and insecurities to people who don\'t even know us is more complicated than it seems; people like to listen to someone they can admire.\\n\\nBut the comments and affection from people who came to talk to me at the end showed me that the idea of connecting with those present not only worked but truly inspired some people, and that made me very happy \u2728\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfa4 The talk\\n\\nI wondered if people would be interested in this topic, but gradually the room filled up and someone even sat on the floor at the very beginning.\\n\\nOriginally, the presentation included some additional studies, including practical screens with real open source contributions, but I had to adapt some things to fit the event\'s format and time.\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nSpoiler (GIF) of the
