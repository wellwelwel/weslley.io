This made me look in the wrong place: projects with few stars and social media with little engagement \ud83d\ude02\\n\\nOn the other hand, my projects had been downloaded more than **10 million** times in **2024** alone, and I didn\'t realize the value of that.\\n\\nSomehow, I felt that in this community I could _\'fix\'_ this in myself. I went to PDS Experience ([Grupo PDS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grupopds/posts/?feedView=all)) and, in short, there I learned in practice:\\n\\n:::note Recognition is about impact.\\n:::\\n\\nThis really simple thought was more than enough to shift my focus to the right place, and it completely changed what my next year would be like: **2025**.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## Spoilers \ud83c\udf7f\\n\\n- The impact led to recognition, which led to the popularity of my main projects \ud83d\udd25\\n- In less than a year, the number jumped from **10 million** to over... **230 million** \ud83c\udf1f\\n- In total, I gave talks to more than **3 thousand people** _(in person and online)_ \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## JANUARY 2025 \ud83c\udf93\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/02.png\' />\\n\\n> First impression of the Awesome You website.\\n\\nI founded [Awesome You](https://awesomeyou.io/) \ud83d\udc1c\\n\\nInstead of just another list of popular projects, I decided to turn my pain into something that would shift people\'s attention beyond the projects they use: to those who maintain them.\\n\\nMore than projects, meet incredible people \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7\\n\\nAnd it worked: even without ever spending a single cent on ads, zero partnerships or promotions, the [Awesome You](https://awesomeyou.io/) website has already had more than **40 thousand unique visits** so far \ud83d\udd25\\n\\n_Not only that, the initiative features incredible people. It\'s truly worth getting to know them_ \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nBesides that, I also officially joined NodeBR \ud83d\udc22\u2728\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## MARCH 2025 \ud83d\udc37\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/03.png\' />\\n\\n> GitHub Brasil: Open Source Friday, 03/14/2025 \u2014 Pachi Parra and me.\\n\\nMy first talk of the year was, simply put, on the official [GitHub Brasil](https://www.linkedin.com/company/github-brazil/posts/?feedView=all) channel, showcasing [Poku](https://poku.io/) in practice, complete with Live Coding and even open questions about open source.\\n\\nIn fact, it was the premiere Live of the Open Source Friday program, with [\ud83e\udd51 Pachi Parra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pachicodes/) \ud83c\udf89\\n\\nMy biggest impact comes specifically from **GitHub**, where all my open source projects are hosted. Now imagine how happy I was to be able to debut the program, feel the reception from people watching, and see folks even making memes about buff **Poku** \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n\u2014 _By the way, I\'m missing a GitHub Stars here, huh?_ \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## MAY 2025 \ud83c\udfc6\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/04.png\' width={480} />\\n\\n> \ud83c\udfc6 Unboxing Microsoft MVP Award 2025 with Roberto and me.\\n\\nAt exactly 4 AM on May 1st, I received the email saying I was accepted into the **Microsoft MVP** program.\\n\\nThis was the first and probably the biggest proof that **impact indeed leads to recognition** \ud83c\udf96\ufe0f\\n\\nThe coolest part?\\n\\n**100%** of my contributions directly involve open source and how my projects and contributions impact the **Microsoft** ecosystem at various levels, especially:\\n\\n- **GitHub**, **TypeScript** & **Node.js**, and **Azure**.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nStill in May, I received a truly unexpected mention after a comment on **YouTube**:\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/05.png\' width={480} />\\n\\n> Deyvid Nascimento on Live at Faculdade Impacta Digital.\\n\\n:::note \'Every time I think about open source, I remember him.\' \u2014 [Deyvid Nascimento](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deyvidnascimento/) (our dear [mano deyvin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chorume/posts/?feedView=all)) \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\\n:::\\n\\nHere you can see how things completely changed from **2024** to **2025**, right? \ud83d\udd25\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## JUNE 2025 \ud83d\uddfb\\n\\nFor the first time in my life:\\n\\n- I visited another country (**Cusco**) \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddea\\n- I saw and touched **snow** \u2744\ufe0f\\n- I fed **Llamas** and **Alpacas** \ud83e\udd99\\n- I experienced temperatures below **0 \xbaC** \ud83e\udd76\\n- I climbed **mountains** _(that one was rough, hehe)_\\n\\nBesides my wife, traveling with such dear people as [Erick Wendel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickwendel/) and [Ana Neri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ananeridev/) was what made everything even more special.\\n\\nOne day I\'m following these two references on my computer screen, and out of nowhere, I find myself traveling the world with them \ud83d\ude02\\n\\nFrom the most sincere place inside me, this unexpected friendship is the greatest gift 2025 gave me \ud83d\udc9a\ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udc99\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/06.png\' width={480} />\\n\\n> \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddea Laguna Humantay: Erick Wendel, Ana Neri, Micaele (my wife, who doesn\'t have LinkedIn), and me.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/07.png\' />\\n\\n> Microsoft Reactor.\\n\\nI organized my first event for [NodeBR](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nodebr/) and [Awesome You](https://awesomeyou.io/).\\n\\nAn interesting fact:\\n\\n- The event was at exactly the same location as my first talk, at **Microsoft Reactor** \ud83d\udc1d\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## JULY 2025 \ud83d\udc3c\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/08.png\' />\\n\\n> Codecon Summit, 07/19/2025\\n\\nOn July 19th, I delivered my biggest talk of the year, with more than **500 people** in person.\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/09.png\' />\\n\\n> Codecon Summit, 07/19/2025 from the speaker\'s perspective.\\n\\nThe coolest part about having a full house is that it wasn\'t a talk about _hype_ or **Artificial Intelligence**: it was a talk deconstructing an open source project I built from complete scratch and teaching how to create... A test runner \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\uddea\\n\\nBut it wasn\'t random: the event theme was literally **\'Embrace the Hacker Way\'** at [Codecon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codecondev/posts/?feedView=all) Summit.\\n\\n_If you enjoy speaking, pay attention to this next part_ \u2b07\ufe0f\\n\\nI want to give a special thanks here to [Marcel dos Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelgsantos/) who made me rethink even more the smallest details when submitting talks, where literally everything matters, for example:\\n\\n- Is your portfolio up to date? Does it work? Does it make sense with the image you want to convey?\\n- Is it easy to find your contributions and projects?\\n- How do we impact and communicate with the developer community?\\n- Is the talk aligned with the event theme?\\n\\nYou see it goes far beyond just submitting content and waiting? \ud83d\udca1\\n\\n_Well, it\'s only fair to thank [Gabriel Nunes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielnunes/) again for making one of the most incredible events of my life a reality_ \ud83e\udef0\ud83c\udffb\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/10.png\' />\\n\\n> Papinho Tech, 07/09/2025 \u2014 YouTube and Spotify.\\n\\nI was invited for the first time to participate in a **Podcast**, [Papinho Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/papinhotech/posts/?feedView=all) by [Gustavo Caetano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oguscaetano/).\\n\\nIn fact, [it\'s worth watching again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdtgG6AAuIA) \ud83c\udfa7\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## AUGUST 2025 \ud83c\udf81\\n\\nUnlike all previous talks, where I submitted each one myself and waited for curation, this was the first time I received an invitation to speak at an event.\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/11.jpeg\' />\\n\\n> EACH-USP: Information Systems\' Week\\n\\nThe coolest part: it was my birthday month. So, [Estevon Biazussi Bonai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/estevon-biazussi-bonai-b0188b302/) ended up giving me my first birthday present \u2728\\n\\nOf all the talks I\'ve ever given, this was the one where I received the most questions after finishing: **it was over 15 minutes of Q&A**.\\n\\nThanks for the patience, [Information Systems\' Week](https://www.linkedin.com/company/semandesi/posts/?feedView=all)! I hope with so many questions, people must have enjoyed the content \ud83d\ude02\\n\\nAnd to close with a flourish:\\n\\n- **It was my first time closing an event** \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e\\n- On the other hand, imagine the pressure of speaking right after [Professor Isidro PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/professor-isidro-phd/) \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## SEPTEMBER 2025 \ud83c\udf0a\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/12.jpeg\' />\\n\\n> Roga DX: the largest technology event in Northeast Brazil\\n\\nImagine giving a talk on such delicate topics, such as:\\n\\n- Data Exposure\\n- Vulnerabilities\\n- Consequences that lead to user life risks\\n- Bringing real cases of vulnerabilities that led to cyberbullying and involved one of the most dangerous internet communities and the **FBI** \ud83d\udea8\\n\\n... And then simply having the **Technology Secretariat of the ALAGOAS STATE GOVERNMENT itself** share your talk \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nAnd as if it couldn\'t get any better, I simply recorded a **Podcast** in a glass room at [Roga DX](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rogadx/posts/?feedView=all) with [Gustavo Guanabara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guanabara/), one of the biggest inspirations in my life \ud83d\udd96\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/13.png\' width={480} />\\n\\n> Roga DX: a very happy person and Gustavo Guanabara.\\n\\nImagine having the opportunity to share experiences and knowledge through open source with the people you admire most.\\n\\n- Here I realized the importance of bringing content that goes beyond code and speaks directly to real life.\\n- How having **quality networking** takes us to unimaginable places and people.\\n- _Enjoying the beach is sometimes good_ \ud83d\ude0c\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n### I delivered my first duo talk:\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/14.jpeg\' />\\n\\n> TDC S\xe3o Paulo: Larissa Azevedo and me.\\n\\nThere\'s a really interesting curiosity/strategy here _(and a bit of culture)_:\\n\\nLast year I joined [Larissa Azevedo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larissasazevedo/)\'s mentorship, not with the intent of the mentorship itself, but to get closer to someone who gives various talks in the most diverse places, and she accepted the \'challenge\'.\\n\\nMy intention was simple:\\n\\n- To be close to someone who is close to people I want to get closer to.\\n- As a bonus, participate and learn from a truly welcoming community.\\n\\nI knew I would eventually reach various places on my own, but you know that saying?\\n\\n:::note If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\\n:::\\n\\nNo coaching phrases here: this saying leads to the African philosophy [_**\'I am because we are\'**_](https://cienciaviva.org.br/ubuntu-eu-sou-porque-nos-somos/), the inspiration behind the creation of **Ubuntu** (yes, the operating system).\\n\\nAnd this was my main strategy for **2025**:\\n\\n- Walk alongside those who have already lived what I want to live, who have already walked the paths I want to walk.\\n\\nThat said, what started with _\'being close [...]\'_ led to two duo talks with the person I trusted with this strategy and who ended up trusting me back \u2728\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## NOVEMBER 2025 \ud83d\ude31\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/15.png\' />\\n\\n- [**Poku hits over 100 thousand downloads per year**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wellwelwel_o-poku-bateu-a-marca-de-100-mil-downloads-activity-7395833452207599616-xeO3/) (over **150 thousand** in gross total).\\n- [**The sum of all my open source projects surpasses 200 million per year**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wellwelwel_infelizmente-minha-maior-expectativa-para-activity-7400112046891163648-XDq8/) (**233 million** currently and almost **280 million** in gross total).\\n\\nThis was my goal for, _who knows_, the end of **2026**:\\n\\n- It didn\'t even reach **December 2025** and it was already done \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## DECEMBER 2025 \ud83e\udd20\\n\\n### I delivered my first mentorship and of course it was about open source:\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/16.jpeg\' />\\n\\n> DevFest Cerrado, 12/13/2025: Open mentorship on open source.\\n\\nTo close the year in style, I wanted to make a parallel with **2024**, and with special thanks to [Wendel Marques](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendelmarques/), I had the opportunity to make this possible:\\n\\n- Finish **2025** speaking at the same event I finished **2024**: **DevFest Cerrado** by [GDG Goi\xe2nia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gdggoiania/posts/?feedView=all) \u2728\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/17.jpeg\' />\\n\\n> DevFest Cerrado, 12/13/2025: My last talk of the year.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nI want to give an especially special thanks to my wife, who accompanied me throughout this entire journey.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/articles/2025/retrospective/18.png\' width={480} />\\n\\nOf course, there\'s no way to fit everything here, but if you follow me, you\'ve certainly seen what didn\'t fit here \ud83e\udef0\ud83c\udffb\\n\\n- If you organize events and made it this far, **I\'ll be very happy to be invited to your event** \ud83c\udfa4\\n\\nThank you so much if anyone had the courage to make it this far\u2014not a single letter was written by AI, _I swear_!\\n\\n- Everything is **100%** human and every single character was manually written by me _(including the em dashes \u2014 <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd>)_.\\n\\n### Bring on 2026!
