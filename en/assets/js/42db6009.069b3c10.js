create a test runner from scratch?<br />\\nMore than that: how do you test a test runner?\\n:::\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nIn this talk, I break down Poku, the only Brazilian _test runner_ for **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, which challenges more than 14 years of language history by bringing native **JavaScript** syntax to tests.\\n\\nYou\'ll learn about the power of subprocesses, isolation, and the advantages of working with concurrency\u2014all using only native language features.\\n\\nWait, native syntax?\\n\\nYou\'ll discover the history of testing in **JavaScript** and why tests don\'t follow the natural flow of the language, while uncovering the inner workings of the most popular _test runners_.\\n\\nThis is the kind of insight that, regardless of which _tester_ you use, will change the way you truly see testing."},{"id":"/2025/06/14/winx-day","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/talks/2025/06/14/winx-day","source":"@site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog-talks/2025/06/14/winx-day.mdx","title":"Winx Day

**Bun**, and **Deno**.\\n\\nThere was even live coding, demonstrating in practice why other test runners are not fully compatible with all JavaScript backends and how **Poku** challenges more than 12
