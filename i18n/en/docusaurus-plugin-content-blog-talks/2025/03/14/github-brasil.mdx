üìπ **Talk (Live):** Meeting [**Poku**](https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku).

:::note
In a conversation that was both technical and casual, I had the honor of kicking off the very first edition of **Open Source Friday** by [**GitHub Brasil**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/github-brazil), hosted by [**Pachi Parra**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pachicodes/).

During the live session, I was able to share a bit about myself, the importance of open source, motivations, challenges, and future plans for [Poku](https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku), as well as give some great tips for those who want to contribute for the first time, especially for those who feel insecure.

In one hour of live streaming, there were conversations, low vs. too-high microphone volume, explanations about module systems, and the differences in behavior between **Node.js**, **Bun**, and **Deno**.

There was even live coding, demonstrating in practice why other test runners are not fully compatible with all JavaScript backends and how **Poku** challenges more than 12 years of language history by bringing JavaScript's natural flow to testing.
