üéôÔ∏è **Talk:** Creating a Test Runner: What happens behind the tests?

:::note
There's a lot of talk about testing, but what's it like to create a test runner from scratch?<br />
More than that: how do you test a test runner?

{/* truncate */}

In this talk, I break down Poku, the only Brazilian _test runner_ for **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, which challenges more than 14 years of language history by bringing native **JavaScript** syntax to tests.

You'll learn about the power of subprocesses, isolation, and the advantages of working with concurrency‚Äîall using only native language features.

Wait, native syntax?

You'll discover the history of testing in **JavaScript** and why tests don't follow the natural flow of the language, while uncovering the inner workings of the most popular _test runners_.

This is the kind of insight that, regardless of which _tester_ you use, will change the way you truly see testing.
