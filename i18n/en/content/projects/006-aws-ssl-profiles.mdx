ðŸ“œ Originated from a _confusion_ after **AWS** changed all its authentication certificates for **RDS** services, breaking systems that had been working perfectly for years, this project came about to unify the certificates in one place.

This way, any maintainer of a project that depends on these certificates (`mysql`, `mysql2` and `pg` in particular) no longer has to worry about unexpected updates.

Despite its simplicity, it's downloaded **more than 5 million** times a month.
