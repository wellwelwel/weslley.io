üê∑ As a dependency creator, the initial idea was to create a _test runner_ that would truthfully ensure that my projects worked for **Node.js**, **Deno** and **Bun** at the same time, using the same test suite to do so. Then an idea came to me along the way: **What if I made testing easy?**

As result, a zero-configuration _test runner_ has arisen, which goes back to the **JavaScript** origins and brings back its native syntax essence for tests, plus performing <Link to='https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku/blob/main/benchmark/README.md'>up to 5 times faster</Link> than the most popular _test runner_ in the entire **JavaScript** ecosystem in a simple _benchmark_.
