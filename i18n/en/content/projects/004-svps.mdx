🚀 The original idea was just to automate some personal tasks when I purchased a “zeroed” **VPS** or **EC2**, but it ended up becoming an extremely robust **ORM** for **Ubuntu** servers.

As well as repairing and installing the most commonly used tools on servers in a granular approach, **SVPS** also enables you to create _proxies_ automatically, directing ports to any domain or subdomain you want.

This project is currently one of the main sources of my company's profits.
