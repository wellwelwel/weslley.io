🎨 A cute "gothic pastel" theme inspired by **Poku's** _test runner_ visual identity.

While **Poku** test runner makes testing easier, **Poku**'s theme makes it easy to read your code, since it's not just about combining colors, but establishing consistency between different language syntaxes.

You can check with your favorite theme if the types in **TypeScript** and **PHP** have the same color, because in **Poku Theme** it will 😏
