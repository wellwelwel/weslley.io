🎙️ **Talk:** From Code to the Real World: The Meeting Point between Data, Testing and Security

:::note Summary

We'll demystify everything you know about development and explore how to make our application predictable against the unpredictable.

<Side id="resume">

Testing our application's functionality? That's easy.
Breaking our application before the user or an attacker does? That's different.

More than testing, you'll learn to build truly secure systems and understand in practice the impact of data being transformed in the worst possible way: through real attacks.

And if you think security is only about code, even the LGPD will be covered here from the perspective of someone who managed to access our database in full.

You'll realize that tests aren't an extra task: they are part of our application and essential for both digital and human security.
