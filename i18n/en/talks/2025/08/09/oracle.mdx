In this talk, I share the behind-the-scenes of rebuilding a critical open source ecosystem library, **MySQL2**, to efficiently process billions of **MySQL** requests.

We'll go through the problems, ideas, implementations, how to teach **LLMs** to handle something new, and even the remediation of 4 large-scale critical vulnerabilities (**CVEs**).

Additionally, you'll learn about the process of making the largest **MySQL** client for **JavaScript** compatible with **TypeScript**, **Bun**, **Deno**, and **Cloudflare Workers**.
