🎙️ **Talk:** Uncovering Tests: Creating Secure and Resilient Systems  
🤝 **Feat:** [Larissa Azevedo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larissasazevedo/)

:::note Summary

- Test the functionality of our application? ✅
- Break our application before the user or an attacker? That's different.

Let's demystify test coverage and understand how to create tests that make our application predictable against the unpredictable.

More than just testing, you will learn to create secure validations and understand in practice the impact of data transformation.

And if you think security is just about code, even the LGPD will come through here from the perspective of someone who managed to access our database.

The idea is for you to realize that tests are not an additional task: they are part of our application and are essential for digital and human security.
